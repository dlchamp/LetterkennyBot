# LetterkennyBot

My friends and I are pretty large fans of Letterkenny and as I'm learning Python I wanted to try my hand and building a bot for our Discord server


The bot responds to a few different phrases:

1. "Fuck you shoresy" (or any phrases that include "Shoresy") - Will respond with one of the many Shoresy quotes from the show.
2. "Happy Birthday" (or any phrase that includes "birthday" - will respond with a super soft birthday .gif  
3. "How are ya now" - Responds with "Not so bad." 
4. "To be fair" - responds with to be fair .gif
5. "Fucking embarrassing" - responds with coach kicking trashcan .gif
6. One of the responses will be "Fight me, see what happens", user can repond with "What's gonna happen" (or any variation) and the bot will respond with a Shoresy quote on the subject


This project will be improved over time and more functions and/or quotes will be added.
